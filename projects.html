            This is a map of recent whale sightings in the Seattle Area. It's was built with React.js, Google Maps API,
            and
            google-map-react. Whale sightings data was provided by The Whale Museum's API. The project is not live yet
            but
            the code is posted on Github and can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/AndrewZamora/Whale-Sightings-Map"
